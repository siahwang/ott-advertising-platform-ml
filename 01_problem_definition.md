# OTT Advertising Market Optimization: Problem Definition

## Executive Summary
**Korean OTT advertising market lacks predictive tools for optimal timing and targeting, causing 20-30% budget waste for advertisers and missed dynamic pricing opportunities for platforms.**

---

## Market Context

Korea's OTT advertising market has exploded since launching in 2022, with Wavve, Tving, and Watcha competing intensively. The market grew 8x from 2022-2024 and is projected to reach ₩260 billion KRW by 2026 (238% CAGR). Consumer adoption is accelerating rapidly—24.6% already subscribe to ad-supported tiers with 85% retention rates.

However, Korean OTT platforms still follow legacy linear TV practices, using prime-time (9 PM) pricing models that ignore OTT's personalized viewing patterns and real-time data advantages.

## Core Problem

**Advertisers and OTT platforms lack data-driven tools for advertising timing and pricing optimization, leading to suboptimal ROI and missed revenue opportunities in Korea's fast-growing ₩260 billion OTT advertising market.**

## Key Pain Points

### Advertiser Challenges
* **Reactive Decision-Making**: Rely mostly on post-campaign metrics (CTR, ROAS, completion rates) instead of predictive indicators for timing decisions
* **Economic Data Gap**: Proven leading indicator KAI (Korea Advanced Institute Economic Forecast Index) for consumer behavior is not systematically utilized
* **Legacy Approach**: Current linear TV methods (prime-time focused) are unsuitable for OTT's real-time data environment

### OTT Platform Limitations
* **Static Pricing**: Fixed ad rates regardless of economic conditions, viewer engagement, or seasonal demand
* **Revenue Optimization Gap**: Cannot implement dynamic pricing during high-engagement periods (KAI upturn phases)
* **Poor Forecasting**: Limited ability to predict ad inventory demand across economic cycles
* **Platform Fragmentation**: Average household uses 3.8 services but lacks unified measurement framework

### Market-Wide Inefficiencies
* **Segment Blindness**: Different demographics (e.g. 20s vs 40s) respond to economic signals at different speeds and direction, but current systems treat all audiences uniformly

## Solution Opportunity

### Economic Validation
**KAI Predictive Power**: Historical analysis shows KAI signals market turning points 1-2 quarters ahead of CSI and GDP, providing actionable lead time for advertising optimization.

### Platform Benefits
A KAI-integrated prediction platform can deliver:
- **Improved advertiser ROAS** through optimized timing
- **Increased OTT platform revenue** via dynamic pricing
- **Enhanced market efficiency** by reducing information asymmetry

**Core Innovation**: First platform to systematically correlate macroeconomic indicators (KAI) with OTT advertising performance, moving Korea's rapidly expanding OTT advertising market from legacy prime-time models to predictive, data-driven execution for maximum market efficiency.
